            <h2>Detailed Timeline</h2>
            <p>This section provides a detailed timeline of the strange anomalies discovered throughout the Counter-Strike: Source maps.</p>
            <p><strong>Event 1 - Dust2 Error:</strong> In early 2023, players began noticing strange errors on the famous "de_dust2" map. Triggers that should have activated certain events were removed, causing players to wander into hidden areas that were not part of the normal map design.</p>
            <p><strong>Event 2 - Italy Glitch:</strong> Around the same time, "cs_italy" saw unexplained glitches, with players reporting that enemies appeared in spots they couldn't normally access. This phenomenon baffled many players.</p>
            <p><strong>Event 3 - Nuke Shadows:</strong> A bizarre event occurred on "de_nuke" when players started noticing shadows moving without any light source. The anomaly was captured on multiple streams.</p>
            <p><strong>Event 4 - Office Item Spawns:</strong> On "cs_office," rare items began spawning at random locations, with no clear trigger, leading players to investigate whether the map had been tampered with.</p>
