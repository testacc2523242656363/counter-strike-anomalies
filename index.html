        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In the world of Counter-Strike: Source, players have reported strange anomaliesâ€”unexpected phenomena that occur in various maps. These anomalies range from strange visual distortions to inexplicable events that seem out of place. Some players have observed removed triggers, weird patterns, and areas where players can get to places they aren't supposed to, such as hidden areas or inaccessible parts of the map. These map edits and unexplained occurrences create a sense of unease, adding to the mystery of the game world.</p>
