        <p>Here are some of the most common types of anomalies reported in Counter-Strike: Source:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Glitching Areas:</strong> Hidden areas on the map that players can unintentionally access, often due to improperly placed triggers or invisible walls.</li>
            <li><strong>Strange Entity Behavior:</strong> Unexpected behaviors from game entities, like NPCs or objects, appearing or acting in ways they shouldn't.</li>
            <li><strong>Invisible Walls:</strong> Players find themselves unable to pass through certain areas without any visible barriers, often resulting from map errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio Bugs:</strong> Certain sounds or audio cues play unexpectedly, often in areas that have no apparent reason for their presence.</li>
            <li><strong>Texture Anomalies:</strong> Unusual or incorrect textures appearing in game, often causing a distorted visual experience.</li>
